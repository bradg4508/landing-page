# landing-page

This project will involve setting up a generic webpage with an emphasis on CSS. In the HTML file, I will utilize div elements to create containers for styling purposes within CSS. Also, utilizing Flexbox to create layouts for the different sections of the webpage will be an important highlight of the project.
